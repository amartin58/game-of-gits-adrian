House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

It was the the saddest ending you could imagine. The Lord of the Winterfell, 'fell', and a new Lord of Winterfell is now ruling.

The new Lord, Bruce the Brute, was ruthless. The kingdom fell into dismay.
